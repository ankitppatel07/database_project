# database_project
An application to support Student registration tasks in a university using Oracle's PL/SQL and JDBC.

Prerequisite: Oracle Database 12c installed on your PC. Also you need to set the Url in the java file in order to perform the jdbc connection to the data source. More info --> https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/urls.htm#BEIJFHHB

The repo consists of the java file that runs the interface and the package file that consists of all the procedures and triggers. I have also added the .sql file that consists of all the student data.
