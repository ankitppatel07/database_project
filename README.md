# Student Registration System using PL/SQL and JDBC.

-Developed an application that registers an undergraduate/graduate student along with his/her choice of course into the system using Oracle's PL/SQL and JDBC.
-Implemented PL/SQL procedures, cursors, complex SQL queries and triggers that fulfill the various constraints and perform the task of registering a student, enrolling or de-enrolling a student from a course, checking the grades and pre-requisite course before enrolling into the system.
-Implemented a JDBC connection to store student information.

Prerequisite: Oracle Database 12c installed on your PC. Also you need to set the Url in the java file in order to perform the jdbc connection to the data source. More info --> https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/urls.htm#BEIJFHHB

The repo consists of the java file that runs the interface and the package file that consists of all the procedures and triggers. I have also added the .sql file that consists of all the student data.
