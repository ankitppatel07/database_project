# Student Registration System using PL/SQL and JDBC.

- Developed an application to register an undergrad/grad student along with his/her choice of courses
- Established database connection with the help of JDBC API to store student information into database
- Implemented PL/SQL procedures, cursors, complex SQL queries and triggers to fulfill various constraints and checks grades and pre-requisite courses before enrolling and de-enrolling a student from a course

Prerequisite: Oracle Database 12c installed on your PC. Also you need to set the Url in the java file in order to perform the jdbc connection to the data source. More info --> https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/urls.htm#BEIJFHHB

The repo consists of the java file that runs the interface and the package file that consists of all the procedures and triggers. I have also added the .sql file that consists of all the student data.
